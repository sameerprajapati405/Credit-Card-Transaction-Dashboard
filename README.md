# Credit-Card-Transaction-Dashboard
Power BI dashboard to analyze credit card transactions with key KPIs and customer segmentation insights.
This project presents a dynamic and interactive dashboard built using Power BI to analyze and visualize credit card transaction data. The goal of the dashboard is to provide actionable insights into customer spending behavior, revenue generation, and segmentation to support data-driven business decisions in the financial sector.

The dashboard includes several key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

Total Revenue

Interest Earned

Transaction Volume

Average Transaction Amount

Expenditure Breakdown by Category

Customer Segmentation based on Job and Education

Through effective data modeling, transformation, and DAX calculations, the dashboard aggregates and presents financial metrics in an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Filters and slicers are implemented to allow stakeholders to drill down into specific customer segments or time periods, making the analysis flexible and insightful.

The customer segmentation feature helps identify trends and preferences among different demographic groups, such as which job roles or education levels contribute most to revenue or incur the highest expenditures. This insight can be used to tailor marketing strategies, design new financial products, or improve customer engagement.

In addition, the breakdown of expenditure categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, travel) helps in understanding spending patterns and identifying potential risk areas or opportunities for revenue enhancement.

This project demonstrates the use of Power BI not just for static reporting, but as a powerful tool for business intelligence and interactive data exploration. It reflects real-world applications in banking and financial analytics, showcasing skills in data preparation, visualization, and storytelling.
